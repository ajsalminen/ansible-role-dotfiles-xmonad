ansible-role-dotfiles-xmonad
==========

Description
------------
This is the ansible role for installing and configuring xmonad for my personal
use. files/dotfiles contains the dotfiles that are local to this repo, and is
just copied as is to the home directory. Probably works on Debian-based distros.
